/**
 * The one piece of the agent layer `main.ts` is allowed to import statically.
 *
 * It imports nothing itself, on purpose. §10.9 says that with `agent.enabled: false` the
 * entire feature is inert, and the strongest version of that claim is structural: the
 * boot path can ask whether the feature is on without dragging the firewall, the tool
 * schema, the grammar or a provider adapter into the bundle. Everything else under
 * `src/agent/` reaches the browser only behind a dynamic `import()` that runs after this
 * returns true — so a default build downloads none of it.
 *
 * `config.ts` imports the storage key from here rather than redeclaring it, so the flag
 * this file reads and the config that writes it cannot drift apart.
