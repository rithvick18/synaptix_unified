 * SPEC.md §5.4 / §5.5 / §5.6 — the mission step runner.
 *
 * Three step types, a three-level hint ladder whose level-3 behaviour depends on the step
 * type, skip, and the containment test that keeps a navigate step from hanging when the
 * player is already standing in the target room.
 *
 * §2's hard product rule is why this file contains almost no prose: every instruction,
 * hint and choice string is read from the pack. The two engine-authored strings are the
 * positional "Step n of m" label and the neutral nudge after a choice that was not the
 * answer — neither is autobiographical content, and neither says "wrong".

   *
   * The decision is not taken here. MemoryPack settles it once per question, over the
   * question's full choice list, after every photo has either decoded or failed; this
   * only reads it. That matters because level 2 re-renders the card with a *subset* of
   * the choices, and the style must not change halfway through a question. The UI
   * re-checks the invariant independently when it renders.
   *
   * A choice with nothing behind it — no person, or no matching `options` entry — is
   * dropped rather than rendered as a bare id. Validation rejects such a pack outright,
   * so the only way to reach that is a world and pack that disagree at runtime — and an
   * empty list is what `beginStep` reads as §4.2's "all choice rendering fails".
   *
   * A `text` question never has portraits or voices to begin with, so it skips the
   * photo decision entirely and always renders text cards. That is the same shape §4.2
   * falls back to, which is why the no-mixing rule needs no special case here.
