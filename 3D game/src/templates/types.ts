/**
 * SPEC.md §11.1 — a house template is data, not code.
 *
 * `buildHouse` in `proceduralHouse.ts` is the one generator that turns any `Template`
 * into a `WorldSource`. Nothing in here builds geometry: a template declares where
 * things are, and the generator decides how they are made. Every solid is an
 * axis-aligned world-space box, so collision volumes and visible geometry are
 * described once and cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Units are metres. Yaws are radians about +Y; 0 leaves a builder's local axes aligned
 * with the world's.
 *
 * **Mirroring (§11.3) happens to this data, before any geometry is built** — see
 * `mirror.ts`. That is why every oriented placement below says which of its builder's
 * local axes its asymmetry lies along (`MirrorAxis`): a rotation can move an object
 * but never reflect it, so the mirrored yaw depends on which way the object faces.
