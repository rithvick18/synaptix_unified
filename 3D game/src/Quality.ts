/**
 * SPEC.md §1.1 / §7 — how much resolution this machine can actually afford.
 *
 * Three things decide how sharp the house looks: the size of the texture files, how
 * well those textures are sampled at grazing angles (anisotropy), and how many pixels
 * the renderer draws (device pixel ratio). Each was previously pinned to its cheapest
 * safe value — 1k maps, anisotropy 4, `pixelRatio` 1 — because a fixed low setting is
 * the only one guaranteed not to melt an unknown machine.
 *
 * This module replaces the pin with a measurement. Two parts:
 *
 * 1. **`detectQuality`** reads what the GPU reports about itself and picks a tier. It
 *    is deliberately pessimistic: anything it does not recognise as a real GPU gets the
 *    old settings exactly. A software rasteriser — headless Chrome's SwiftShader, which
 *    is what `npm run check:offline` runs on — is pinned to the old values on purpose,
 *    so the §7 figure that check prints stays comparable with every earlier run.
 *
 * 2. **`AdaptiveResolution`** climbs a pixel-ratio ladder while the frame budget holds
 *    and stops one rung below wherever it started missing. §7 warns that a frame time
 *    sitting on a multiple of the refresh interval is a v-sync reading and not a cost —
 *    which is exactly why it works as a *signal* here. This never reports that interval
 *    as a cost; it only asks "are we still meeting the deadline?", climbs while the
 *    answer is yes, and freezes the moment it is no.
 *
 * Everything below is a pure function of plain values, so `npm run check` exercises the
 * tier rules and the whole ladder without a browser, a GPU or a canvas.
